# Gift-Prediction-Model
 A ML model to predict what gifts to get people.

I'm not very good at getting gifts, so why not let a computer choose for me, right? In order to do this I will be scraping Amazon in order to get various gift ideas. I will use this scraped data to get people to input their opinions (on a scale of 1-10) on random items from the ideas data. Using this I will perform a ML model to (hopefully) allow me to always know what to get my family and freinds as a gift.

Web Scraping: Extracts the name of gift ideas, prices, link to buy, and image URL from Amazon

Data Collection: Uses the extrcated data to collect information about the users preferences
